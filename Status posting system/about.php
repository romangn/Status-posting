In addition to the features required for the website, I decided to do a basic CSS styling in order for the design of the website to be up to standards.
<br>
I did not have a lot of trouble while working on this assignment, the only problems I had included : display of incorrect input and display of the status detailes from the database as the table.
<br>
Next time I would like to make a better design of the website and change the error notification functionality to be displayed as pop up windows without closing the input forms.
<br>
For the database functionality I used the tutorials of the course, however in addition to this I also used the resources from w3schools.com for both php and css functionality.
<br>
By completion of this assignment I improved my knowledge of working with database in php, learned how to effectively process both correct and incorrect user input, and finally learn the CSS styling.
